# Capstone Telecom

Business Task:
A database was provided for analysis containing customer history for the last few years of a fictitious telecom company which has customers for several different services, the main ones being internet and phone.

Analyzing this history, we can see that the company has more than 26% of Churn rate from its customers, which represents a loss of millions for the company.

As a Data Analyst, I must analyze the dataset provided to identify service cancellation trends in order to gain insights and develop recommendations on how the telecom company in question should make decisions based on the analysis.
